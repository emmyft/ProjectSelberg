# Project Selberg

I'm trying to understand the Riemann hypothesis, and this area of research from scratch. I have no training in pure mathematics beyond high school. This git page is a documentation of my progress.

## Scope
(What I want to understand):
- My father's PhD thesis: [Part I](http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~goldston/Tsang1.pdf)
- Michael Atiyah's proof
- (further) the last works of Prof. Atle Selberg

## Introductions
I'm using these videos
- [Visualizing the Riemann hypothesis and analytic continuation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0NjbwqlYw&t=1189s) from 3Blue1Brown
- [Medium: Cantors paradise](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-riemann-hypothesis-explained-fa01c1f75d3f)

## Riemann zeta-function
- The zeta function: ![riemann-zeta function](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31f460a787ebaf667aaf7805f2b87e542a02836b)
- The relationship between the zeta function and primes are proved by Euler's product formula: ![Euler product formula](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ICtYL6VxGoBPdrJXT1b6Sw.png)- the proof is beautiful! see Cantors paradise link above
- The Riemann zeta function is the zeta function defined for all s where the real part of s>1, i.e. Re(s)>1 (if Re(s)<1 then the zeta function will not converge!)
- in order to go outside this normal area of convergence (where it normally diverges), analytic continuation is needed

##Analytic continuation
- [some introduction that I don't fully understand](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath649/kmath649.htm)
- [analytics function](https://math.mit.edu/~jorloff/18.04/notes/topic2.pdf)

## Riemann hypothesis
- From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis):
> The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2
- zeros: values of s when the function=0
- trivial zeros: it's well known that the z-function=0 when s is a negative even number, hence trivial
