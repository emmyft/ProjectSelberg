# Project Selberg

I'm trying to understand the Riemann hypothesis, and this area of research from scratch. I have no training in pure mathematics beyond high school. This git page is a documentation of my progress.

## Scope
(What I want to understand):
- My father's PhD thesis: [Part I](http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~goldston/Tsang1.pdf)
- Michael Atiyah's proof
- (further) the last works of Prof. Atle Selberg

## Introductions
I'm using these videos
- [Visualizing the Riemann hypothesis and analytic continuation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0NjbwqlYw&t=1189s) from 3Blue1Brown

## Riemann hypothesis:
The Riemann zeta function: ![riemann-zeta function](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/31f460a787ebaf667aaf7805f2b87e542a02836b)
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis):
> The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2
